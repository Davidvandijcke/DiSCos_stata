{phang}
{bf:disco} {hline 2} Distributional Synthetic Controls.

{marker description}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:disco} implements the Distributional Synthetic Controls (DiSCo) method based on 
Gunsilius (2023), extending the synthetic 
control methodology of Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) 
to distributions. Instead of focusing solely on aggregate mean outcomes, DiSCo constructs 
synthetic control weights that replicate an entire outcome distribution of a treated unit 
from a set of control units.

{pstd}
By reproducing the quantile function (or, optionally, mixture of distributions) of the 
treated unit before treatment, DiSCo identifies a set of weights that can be used to 
form a synthetic control distribution in all time periods. This synthetic distribution 
then serves as an estimate of the counterfactual distribution of the treated unit 
in the absence of treatment. By comparing the observed treated distribution with 
this synthetic counterpart, DiSCo estimates distributional treatment effects such as 
differences in quantiles, CDFs, and other distributional functionals.

{pstd}
This approach is suitable for settings where one aims to identify heterogeneous treatment 
effects along the entire distribution of outcomes, rather than focusing solely on averages. 
The method is particularly useful when richer micro-level data are available at the unit level 
(e.g., states, firms) but individuals within those units cannot be tracked over time.

{pstd}
{cmd:disco} also supports bootstrap inference for confidence intervals, permutation tests 
analogous to the classical synthetic control permutation inference, and graphical summaries 
of results.

{pstd}
{it:varlist} must contain exactly three variables in the following order:

{phang2}1. Outcome variable (numeric){p_end}
{phang2}2. Unit ID variable (numeric){p_end}
{phang2}3. Time period variable (integer){p_end}

{pstd}
{cmd:idtarget()} and {cmd:t0()} are required.

{marker options}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Required}

{phang}
{opt idtarget(#)} specify the id of the treated unit.

{phang}
{opt t0(#)} specify the first treatment period.

{dlgtab:Optional}

{phang}
{opt m(integer)} number of quantile points used for quantile-based estimation. default is 100.

{phang}
{opt g(integer)} number of grid points for cdf estimation. default is 100.

{phang}
{opt ci} compute bootstrap confidence intervals for distributional effects.

{phang}
{opt boots(integer)} number of bootstrap replications for confidence intervals. default is 300.

{phang}
{opt cl(real)} confidence level for intervals. default is 0.95.

{phang}
{opt qmin(real)} minimum quantile for estimation range. default is 0. Setting this to a value greater than 0
restricts the estimation range to the interval [qmin, qmax], which can be useful to focus on a specific part of the distribution.

{phang}
{opt qmax(real)} maximum quantile for estimation range. default is 1. Setting this to a value less than 1 restricts the estimation range. 


{phang}
{opt nosimplex} do not constrain weights to lie in a unit simplex. by default, weights are nonnegative 
and sum to one. specifying {cmd:nosimplex} allows weights to take any values that sum to one.

{phang}
{opt mixture} use the mixture (cdf-based) approach instead of the quantile-based approach.

{phang}
{opt permutation} perform a permutation test by treating each control unit as a "placebo" treated unit 
and computing test statistics. Returns a p-value.

{phang}
{opt seed(integer)} set the random seed for reproducibility. default is -1 (no seed set).

{phang}
{opt nouniform} when computing confidence intervals, do not compute uniform confidence bands; 
only pointwise intervals are computed.

{phang}
{opt agg(string)} specify the type of aggregation for summary statistics and plots. one of:
{p_end}
{phang2}- {cmd:"quantile"}: summarize estimated quantile functions{p_end}
{phang2}- {cmd:"cdf"}: summarize estimated cdfs{p_end}
{phang2}- {cmd:"quantileDiff"}: summarize differences in quantiles between treated and synthetic{p_end}
{phang2}- {cmd:"cdfDiff"}: summarize differences in cdfs between treated and synthetic{p_end}
See {help "disco##related":Additional commands}. 

{phang}
{opt samples(numlist)} specify quantile or cdf points for summary statistics. for quantiles, these are in [0,1]. 
for cdfs, these are values of the outcome variable. If not specified, the default is to partition the support 
(either [0,1] or the range of the outcome variable) into 4 equally spaced points and aggregate the treatment effects within 
those intervals.

{marker method}
{title:Method and Formulation}

{pstd}
Distributional synthetic controls extend the idea of synthetic controls to the entire 
outcome distribution. Instead of matching average outcomes, we match entire quantile 
functions or CDFs of control units to replicate the pre-treatment distribution of a 
treated unit. Post-treatment differences then yield distributional treatment effects.

{pstd}
Consider a treated unit indexed by 1 and control units indexed by j=2,...,J+1 observed 
over periods t=1,...,T, with t0 < T as the first treatment period. Don't get confused! 
Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)  use T0 to denote the last pre-treatment period, so t0 = T0 + 1. 
Let Y_{jt} be outcomes for unit j in period t. We want to estimate the counterfactual distribution 
Y_{1t,N}, t>T0 that would have prevailed for the treated unit in the absence of treatment.


{pstd}
The key object we want to estimate is the (unobserved) counterfactual quantile function of unit 1
in the absence of treatment. The disco command does this by essentially estimating a regression of
the treated units' quantile function before treatment on a weighted average of the untreated units' 
quantile functions before treatment, where the weights are estimated to minimize the "sum of least squares" 
between the quantile functions, and have to sum up to 1. The resulting weighted average 
of quantile functions is the "synthetic" quantile function. The key assumption allowing the consistent estimation
of treatment effects after treatment is that the weights, which were estimated using pre-treatment data only,
remain "optimal" post-treatment, see the Appendix in Gunsilius (2023). 

As an alternative to the quantile-based approach, the mixture approach estimates the counterfactual
distribution by estimating a weighted average of the untreated units' CDFs before treatment. This approach
is useful when working with variables that have fixed support, such as categorical variables - see Van Dijcke, Gunsilius, and Wright (2024).
